Freelance Finder
================

Basic site to gather and track different places where jobs I might want to
apply for are posted.  This exists mostly because I'm lazy but somehow that
means I'm willing to spend a lot of time and effort making a site to save
myself a few minutes of clicking.  I don't know either.
